## Projects
### LLM on your data
[Repo]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048](https://github.com/theamar961/LLMOnYourData))

Leveraged Langchain to tailor OpenAI gpt3.5 LLM, enabling the simulation of a chatbot experience with RAG. Integrated LLM and a Pinecone vector database, incorporating data wrangling, retrieval, and querying functionalities. My solution can serve as a versatile chatbot suitable for advanced analytics use cases in any industry.


### Quantitative Analysis - Power Industry
[Repo]([https://github.com/theamar961/Financial-Data-Science])

Developed data flows to analyze trading data to evaluate stocks based on growth metrics and risk indicators. Narrated stock performance when looked in the aspect of real-life parameters vs when looked at in the aspect of data. My solution can be used to evaluate and visualize a stock’s performance based on its quantitative metrics.
